# Overview of the Project

### Project: Sentiment Analysis Using NLP

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on the "Sentiment_Analysis_Dataset". 
The model is trained to classify text into three sentiment categories: Negative, Neutral, and Positive. 
The project involves preprocessing text data, building a classification pipeline with TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression, and evaluating the modelâ€™s performance through cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and various visualizations.

## Key Activities
1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Loaded and inspected the sentiment analysis dataset.
    - Preprocessed text data by:
        - Tokenizing
        - Lemmatizing
        - Removing stopwords

2. **Model Building**:
    - Created a machine learning pipeline using:
        - TF-IDF Vectorizer
        - Logistic Regression
    - Conducted cross-validation to assess initial performance.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    - Used GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Evaluated using:
        - Accuracy
        - Classification report
        - Confusion matrix
    - Plotted:
        - Confusion matrix
        - Sentiment distribution of predictions

5. **Model Saving**:
    - Saved the trained model and TF-IDF Vectorizer using `pickle`.

6. **User Interface**:
    - Implemented a function to predict sentiment for user-provided text input.
